title: "Hello World"

Is this working? Yes, it seems like it is!

I'm trying out [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I decided to fork the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme, and  so far it's pretty easy to use.

My hope is to use this page to write about work in progress, perhaps things that are not always ocean related.
