# Data Examples

A collection of simple python notebooks to help me remember how to access publicly available ocean data sets and make simple plots. Many of them use xarray -- possibly to the exclusion of other tools that might work (but xarray is the best!). The code can be viewed on my [github page ](https://github.com/nlbeaird/ocean_data_examples)

Almost all the examples are things I'm learning from others expertise on the web, and *for sure* all the tools are due to the expertise and effort of others! So thanks!!

Some are just scratch paper and not fleshed out at all.

Many of these are examples I use(d) in my integrated ocean observing class. Hopefully contributions from students to follow!

Examples include:

* plotting ocean color from ESA and NASA
* accessing and plotting optimally interpolated SST from NOAA
* loading and plotting high resolution output from a data-assimilative ROMS model (DOPPIO)
* access and plot surface currents from HF radar stations or the OSCAR model
* Look at slices of the ocean from the World Ocean Atlas


Hopefully by clicking the following badge you can **run these notebooks** without installing anything!: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nlbeaird/ocean_data_examples.git/master)

(seems to take a long time to load)
