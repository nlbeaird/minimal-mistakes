# Data Examples

A collection of simple python notebooks to help me remember how to access publicly available ocean data sets and make simple plots. Many of them use xarray -- possibly to the exclusion of other tools that might work (but xarray is the best!). The code can be viewed on my [github page ](https://github.com/nlbeaird/ocean_data_examples)

Almost all the examples are things I'm learning from others expertise on the web, and *for sure* all the tools are due to the expertise and effort of others! So thanks!!

Some are just scratch paper and not fleshed out at all.

Many of these are examples I use(d) in my integrated ocean observing class. Hopefully contributions from students to follow!


Hopefully by clicking the link below you can [**run these notebooks**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nlbeaird/ocean_data_examples.git/master) without installing anything!

(seems to take a long time to load)
